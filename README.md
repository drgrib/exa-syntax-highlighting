EXA is a programming language used to solve puzzles in the game [EXAPUNKS][exapunks] by [Zachtronics][zachtronics].

### From the game manual

Keep in mind this is written as if it were documentation for the EXA language from the game universe:

> The EXA virtual machine (EXA-VM) allows many execution agents (EXAs) to execute in a shared network of host computers.
> Within a network, EXAs can be dynamically created, destroyed, and transferred from one host to another.
> The EXA-VM enables all EXAs to run independently and simultaneously, even when multiple EXAs are located within the same host.
> An EXA's program consists of a series of instructions. Each instruction requires zero or more operands...
